## Zookeeper

Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service which eases the development of distributed applications. It's used by projects like Apache Hadoop, HBase and others for different use cases like leader election, configuration management, node coordination, server lease management, etc.

Nodes within ZooKeeper cluster store their data in a shared hierarchal namespace which is similar to a standard file system or a tree data structure.

## Kafka

Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that maintains feeds of messages in partitioned and replicated topics. In the simplest way there are three players in the Kafka ecosystem: producers, topics (run by brokers) and consumers.

**Producers** produce messages to a topic of their choice. It is possible to attach a key to each message, in which case the producer guarantees that all messages with the same key will arrive to the same partition.

**Topics** are logs that receive data from the producers and store them across their partitions. Producers always write new messages at the end of the log. In our example we can make abstraction of the partitions, since weâ€™re working locally.

**Consumers** read the messages of a set of partitions of a topic of their choice at their own pace. If the consumer is part of a consumer group, i.e. a group of consumers subscribed to the same topic, they can commit their offset. This can be important if you want to consume a topic in parallel with different consumers.

### Single node setup

A single-node Kafka broker setup would meet most of the local development needs. So, let's start by learning this simple setup.

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    ports:
      - 22181:2181
  
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - 29092:29092
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:29092
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
```

### Multi node setup

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper-1:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    ports:
      - 22181:2181

  zookeeper-2:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    ports:
      - 32181:2181
  
  kafka-1:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper-1
      - zookeeper-2

    ports:
      - 29092:29092
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper-1:2181,zookeeper-2:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka-1:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:29092
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

      - zookeeper-2
    ports:

    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 2
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper-1:2181,zookeeper-2:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka-2:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:39092
